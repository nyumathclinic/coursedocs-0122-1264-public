      <p><q>The book of the universe is written in the language of mathematics.</q> Galileo wrote this four hundred years ago, even before Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus. The statement is as valid today as ever: We use functions in all the sciences, and calculus allows us to analyze the functions and draw scientific conclusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Calculus II is a second semester calculus course for students who have previously been introduced to the basic ideas of differential and integral calculus. Over the semester we will study three (related) topics, topics that form a central part of the language of modern science:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
            applications and methods of integration, 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            infinite series and the representation of functions by power series, and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            parametric curves in the plane.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The material we take up in this course has applications in physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, astronomy, economics, statistics, and just about everything else. We want you to leave the course not only with computational ability, but with the ability to use these notions in their natural scientific contexts, and with an appreciation of their mathematical beauty and power.

          Lecture sections meet twice weekly for 75 minutes, led by a professor.
          Recitation sections meets once weekly for 75 minutes, led by a teaching assistant.

        <title>How the Credit Hours are Met by the Course</title>
        <p>
          This class meets for 3 hours and 45 minutes each week and carries the
          expectation that students will work on course learning activities
          (e.g. reading, problem sets, papers, and studying) for about 7 hours
          and 30 minutes outside of classroom per week. The syllabus includes
          more information about meeting times and expectations for student
          work.

    <title>Learning Activities</title>
    <p>
      Most weeks will follow the same pattern of engagement with the course
      material. It alternates between instruction and assessment, and is
      designed for you to have many opportunities to practice, ask for help, and
      get feedback on every topic. 
    </p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Pre-lecture activities</title>
      <p>
        Before each lecture, you will be expected to complete a reading
        assignment. The assignment may also include watching videos and
        completing a basic quiz. The goal of these activities is to prepare you
        for lecture. Your professor will also use your responses to these
        activities to prepare for lecture.
      </p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Lecture</title>
      <p>
        Lectures will be interactive, with opportunities for you to ask
        questions and work on problems. Your professor will also use lecture to
        reinforce new concepts and provide context.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>WebAssignments</title>
      <p>
        After lecture you will continue to practice the procedures and concepts
        through a <q>WebAssignment</q>—that is, an assignment on the WebAssign platform. You
        will have multiple opportunities to attempt these problems, and other
        problems like them. WebAssignments are due before recitation.

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Recitation</title>
      <p>
        Recitation is your weekly class time with your teaching assistant.
        Recitation begins with a quiz and continues with supervised practice
        on worksheets.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Problem sets</title>
      <p>
        Problem sets are due at the end of each week. They are designed to
        challenge you to apply the concepts into new or unique situations.
        Problem sets are also where you learn to present worked solutions
        clearly and logically.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Exams</title>
      <p>
        There will be three chapter tests (70 minutes long, during lecture), and
        one final exam (100 minutes long, during finals period). Chapter tests are
        summative assessments and comprehensive of the course material taught
        until that point. <em>Exams are designed
        to test your mastery of the course material at a deep and synthetic
        level, and whether you can apply it to new settings.</em>
        The final will be cumulative.

      Most of the grade components are identified above. Participation will be
      measured through attendance, completion of in-class activities, and written homework.
      The exact rubric may vary across lecture sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only count the top <em>half</em> of your quizzes and
      required WebAssignments, or as close to half as possible without going over if the total number is odd.
      This should wash out the effects of any unforeseen circumstances which prevent you from
      attending recitation or completing an assignment to the best of your
      ability. <em>There will be no other extensions or makeups beyond this generous drop policy</em>.

      The grade components are averaged into a final calculated grade using the following weights:

      It is possible that these cutoffs will be adjusted at the end of the
      semester, but only in the downward direction in order to raise letter
      grades slightly. There is no school- or departmentally-prescribed
      distribution of letter grades. Letter grades across sections will be
      comparable.

              Math Stack Exchange, Yahoo! Answers, etc. The graders will be able
              to detect if you've copied your work. Aside from the integrity
              issue, students who short-circuit the homework process usually do
              not do well on quizzes and exams.

        If a student submits work that is not their own, with the intention to
        deceive the instructor, then the instructor has no way to evaluate the
        student’s learning.  This usually results in a score of zero, at a
        minimum.  Additionally, any such findings will be reported to the
        applicable dean in the student’s school, for recordkeeping and possible
        further disciplinary action.
